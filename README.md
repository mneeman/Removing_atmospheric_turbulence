# Removing atmospheric turbulence through deep learning
This is the code for my final project in Electrical Engineering degree. 
The project goal is to dsign and train an algorithm for removing atmospheric turbulence through deep learning
A long-distance imaging systems can be strongly affected by atmospheric turbulence which causes geometric distortion (motion), space and time-varying blur.
